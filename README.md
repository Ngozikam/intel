## Upload programs

A number of programs have been provided for testing your Arduino hat. Take a look at `arduino-src/programs`. Each folder contains a .ino that you can open in the Arduino IDE. 

To upload, connect your Arduino to your computer, select the proper port (the software is usually good at identifing the Arduino), and adjust settings for your Arduino as needed. You can then click the upload button and enjoy your work.
